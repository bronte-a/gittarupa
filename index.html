TESTIMONIALS<br><Br>			
Gitta's Ayurvedic body therapy is very therapeutic
Her skilful Touch and years of experience find all my tight spots which brings the energy flow and movement back into my body leaving me with a feeling of deep relaxation and freedom of movement.
I feel refreshed and rejuvenated
I have been enjoying Gitta's  treatment for many many years and cannot recommend her enough!!<br>

I have been a client of Gittas's for 15 years and it is a true pleasure because of her personal warmth, her skill and the attention she pays to my needs.  I work in demanding and stressful situations and the whole experience  of having a treatment by Gitta really makes a difference for me – it is not only relaxing but promotes a feeling of wellbeing and being cared for.  Gitta has often recognised and helped with injuries or problems that I have presented with.  I could not recommend her more highly.<br><p2>Carol Beaumont</p2>

I have been Gitta’s client for almost 4 years. Not only is she a very skilled and intuitive
practitioner, the results of her treatments are amazing.
Within 9 months of working with Gitta the size of my tights reduced by 30 % and my ongoing
tight neck was freed up which finally allowed a dislocated disk to be re-aligned.<Br>

Treating myself to a massage from Gitta is one of the nicest things I can do for myself.  The whole experience is so nourishing .  She has wonderfully strong hands and knows all the right pressure points and ways to get my tense and sometimes knotted up muscles to relax.  After a massage with her I feel relaxed soothed, and reinvigorated all at once - back in touch with my body and beautifully looked after.  Her energy is gentle, warm and nurturing and she creates a space that  one can just totally let go and give into being de-stressed.  She know just the right balance of soft and strong after years of massaging people. She has acquired great skill in working on the body in a nurturing and heart-centred way.

I arrived in Auckland in 2003 and a friend recommended Gitta to me. Frankly I've never looked back. I call Gitta my "Golden Hands" because she always manages to find my aches and pains and diminishes them for me. I admire her holistic approach to healing and as a result I highly recommend her. I am a stage actress and after my often demanding  performances I notice I carry  physical stresses  related to the  character I've portrayed. I always make sure I see Gitta after each show so she can restore and revitalise my body.
Thank you Gitta! You are my Golden Hands!<br>
